## 1.0 // SYSTEM OVERVIEW

**Terminal-U** is a cyber-industrial portfolio interface designed to maximize information density while maintaining high aesthetic standards. It serves as the primary digital access point for Mehdi Acho's research in Deep Learning and GNN architectures.

Unlike standard web deployments, Terminal-U prioritizes:
- **Utilitarian Aesthetics:** Zinc-950 backgrounds with high-contrast data visualization.
- **Interactive CLI:** A functional command line interface for advanced navigation.
- **Data Density:** "Bloomberg Terminal" inspired layouts for skill diagnostics and project manifests.

## 4.0 // FEATURE MANIFEST

### [A] SYSTEM_STATUS PANEL
Located at the top viewport, this module calculates the biological "Uptime" of the user in real-time based on `2002-03-18` epoch. It also displays current geolocation coordinates and connection stability.

### [B] TERMINAL_CLI (Command Line Interface)
A toggleable drawer located at the bottom of the viewport. Supports keyboard input and specific system commands.
- **Input:** Standard alphanumeric text.
- **Response:** JSON-like data output or text streams.

### [C] DIAGNOSTIC_GRID
Skill proficiency is visualized not as arbitrary bars, but as system resource allocation (Memory/Threads/Temperature), fitting the industrial theme.

## 5.0 // CLASSIFIED PROTOCOLS

The CLI supports standard navigation commands (`help`, `status`, `projects`).

However, the system contains encrypted logs regarding the user's true motivations and downtime activities.
> **HINT:** Check the `help` menu carefully. Anomalous signals detected near keyword: `dream`.
