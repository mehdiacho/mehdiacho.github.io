Research My research interest mainly focuses on developing novel models and algorithms for
Interests tackling practical challenges in deploying artificial intelligent systems to various realworld application domains. I am currently interested in the following topics:
• Low-resource learning: meta-learning, network pruning & quantization, few-shot
classification & generation, self-supervised and semi-supervised learning.
• On-device learning: network compression (pruning, quantization, and knowledge
distillation), continual learning, federated learning.
• Safe and secure learning: uncertainty modeling & quantification, robustness to
distributional shifts, defense against adversarial attacks.
• Large-scale learning: meta-learning, neural architecture search, distributed optimization and federated learning.
The application domains of interests include but are not limited to visual recognition
(real-time vision, few-shot image classification and generation), natural language understanding (low-resource language models, question answering/generation, dialogue
agents), speech recognition & synthesis, automatic drug/material discovery, healthcare
and finance.
